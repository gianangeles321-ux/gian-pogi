<div class="memory-text">
<h2>The First Group Picture of the Best</h2>
<p>
This was probably the first group photo of our section during Nutrition Month in the first week of Grade 11. At that time, we were still getting to know each other, so the smiles in the picture carried a hint of awkwardness. We had just started building connections, unsure of how the year would unfold, but there was a quiet sense of excitement. Looking back, it remains a simple yet meaningful memory filled with laughter, new friendships, and the peaceful beginning of a journey we would share together.

<h2>The Rising</h2>
<p>
During the Buwan ng Wika, my friend Kenneth Santos and I joined the slogan making contest in our school. Unexpectedly, I won second place while he placed third. I honestly did not expect to achieve this because I used to doubt my abilities when it came to activities like this. I was not very confident in expressing my ideas through slogans, but this experience became meaningful for me. It proved that sometimes, stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to surprising and rewarding moments. More than the recognition, it was a fun and memorable experience shared with a friend.

<h2>CHAMPIONS!</h2>
<p>
This was the PEAK MOMENT of our Buwan ng Wika celebration. After putting in a lot of effort and spending countless hours practicing for our sabayang pagbigkas presentation, we finally became champions. Hearing our name announced as the winner felt surreal because all the hard work, nervousness, and preparation had paid off. The moment was filled with pride, joy, and excitement as we claimed our victory together. It became one of the most unforgettable achievements we shared as a group.

<h2>The Group Expansion</h2>

This was the moment I started to socialize more and slowly overcome my shyness. During this time, I had the chance to meet new people in our school and eventually build friendships with them.
